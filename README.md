## Description

Daily Cloud has two models: Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). CV models has a purpose for detecting emotion wether the user is happy or sad based on face expression. In the other hand, NLP model is made as a purpose of detecting user mental condition whether depressed or not.

## Architecture

The CV model is made as common CV model with differentiation on its label (emotion detection). 
Next, the NLP model is made as .... (updated soon)
