## Description

Daily Cloud has two models: Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). CV models has a purpose for detecting emotion wether the user is happy or sad based on face expression. In the other hand, NLP model is made as a purpose of detecting user mental condition whether depressed or not.
